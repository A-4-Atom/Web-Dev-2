# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
The **Number Guessing Game** is an interactive and engaging project where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. This game is perfect for showcasing fundamental programming skills, including loops, conditionals, and user interaction. Whether you're a beginner looking to practice coding or an experienced developer aiming to add a fun project to your portfolio, this game is a great choice!

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a new random number at the start of each round.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Players receive hints ("Too high!" or "Too low!") to guide their guesses.
- **Customizable Range**: The number range can be adjusted to make the game easier or more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Optionally track the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Clear instructions and prompts for smooth gameplay.
- **Replay Option**: Restart the game seamlessly without refreshing or relaunching.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the web-based interface (if applicable).
- **CSS**: For styling and making the interface visually appealing.
- **JavaScript/Python/Other**: For implementing the game logic and handling user inputs.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: The game will generate a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1–100).
2. **Make a Guess**: Enter your guess in the input field (web-based) or type it in the terminal (CLI-based).
3. **Receive Feedback**: 
   - If your guess is higher than the number, you’ll see a message like "Too high!"  
   - If it’s lower, you’ll see "Too low!"  
   - When you guess correctly, the game congratulates you and shows your score or number of attempts.
4. **Play Again**: Once you’ve guessed the correct number, you can restart the game to try again.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game interface.
- **styles.css**: A stylesheet to enhance the visual aesthetics of the game (if applicable).
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file implementing game logic (for web-based versions).
- **main.py** or equivalent: Contains the game logic for command-line or non-web-based versions.

## How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/number-guessing-game.git
   cd number-guessing-game
   ```
2. **Run the Application**:  
   - **Web Version**: Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
   - **Command-Line Version**: Run the script (e.g., `python main.py` or `node script.js`).  

## Example Gameplay (CLI Version)
- Game: "Guess the number (between 1 and 100):"  
- User: "50"  
- Game: "Too low! Try again."  
- User: "75"  
- Game: "Too high! Try again."  
- User: "62"  
- Game: "Correct! You guessed the number in 3 attempts."

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
